A place to find blueprints for the Builder in Buildcraft 6.x

The Builder is back in Buildcraft 6.x. This machine let you copy and save structures and buildings as blueprint. 

The most cool feature is that you can share blueprints with the world. I will use this Github to put all my blueprint. 
This way, you can use blueprint to build your base in the beginning of the game.

Tips to find good building

Structure of the blueprint folder
----------------

Each blueprint folder will have the blueprint file (.bpt), a screenshot of the structure and the credits if you are not the author of the build. You must give a link to the author and the project as well. While downloading the blueprint, click on Raw because the Save as link option don't work.
